      <p class="ex1">
      <p> In recent years, the rapid evoloution of social media has changed the way people have communicated giving an easier means of connecting with others. However, as the usage has increased over the years, the negative consequences are starting to be more apparent, rising threats of online bullying, decline in self esteem and disrupted sleep patterns are a few of the many issues the have arised due to social medias rise. The article will sumarise a few of the issues that have been uncovered over the evolution.</p>

     <h3 id="Social Issues">Social Issues</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
      <p>Throughout its evolution, social medias main aim has been to find new ways to keep people in contact with one another constantly updating and adapting the way communication occurs with aims for interactions to be more entertaining and inclusive. However, due to the easy exposure to content, many social problems have occurred during the evolution. In March 2023, a census was taken by ‘The Office for National Statistics’ focusing on the different ways bullying occurs online among children aged 10-15 years of age. The study showed that 92.6% of children went online daily with 58.1% spending 3 or more hours online during a school day which was an increase of 10.5% from results taken in March 2020. An estimated 19.1% of children experienced online bullying with 18.1% of those kids choosing not to tell anyone about what they were facing. 35% of children accepted a friend request from someone they did not know making them susceptible to receiving abuse from those who share no consideration about the way they may be feeling. (Office for National Statistics). All these figures have increased or remained constant from the data taken in March 2020 from which we can interpret that the issue is constantly rising, and not enough measures are being taken to prevent these rises in values. It has also been seen that social media affects self- esteem and was seen the teens are more anxious especially due to the pressure of texting. The lack of in-person interaction has made teenagers unable to interpret body language and facial expressions leading to misunderstanding and hurt feelings. With some experts thinking that connecting with peers online is less emotional than connecting in person. FOMO is another contributing factor which can intensify the feelings of loneliness and self-esteem giving feelings that ithers are having fun or living a better life than you are. Therefore, promoting that feeling of addiction even at risky times. (Dalomba, 2022) (Hillard,2024) A sedentary lifestyle is likely to occur due to the rise of social media since it promotes a life with very few activities. Little activity increases the chance of osteoporosis, due to the lack of calcium and vitamin D intake, reduced bone density and poor bone health. Regular breaks and doing practical activities can reduce the chances of suffering from these diseases and promote good health.

      <p class="ex1">
        <p>Social Media’s influence has heavily affected the physical health of the younger generation. It can cut into the time people spend on activities and hobbies, with the power of communication within the grasp of the hands, this has led to a decrease in children interacting in person and has consequently led to more people leading a sedentary lifestyle. With this sedentary lifestyle comes the increased chances of heart issues, cardiovascular disease, obesity, osteoporosis and many more diseases. (Bergman, 2023) For teenagers, it is deemed that they need between 8-10 hours of sleep every night to prevent sleep deprivation. A study from the National Library of Medicine examined a group of teenagers focusing on the amount of time they spend on social media about the hours of sleep they acquire. Results showed that the median time spent on social media on a normal day was 1-3 hours 32% of teenagers, and 21% used social media for at least 5 hours. Median sleeping time on school days was 22:00-23:00 with 26% falling asleep later and 34% falling asleep between 23:00 and midnight. The median wake time by 07:00-08:00 with 4% waking up later school days and on a free day the median wake time was 10:00-11:00. The results showed that boys were more likely to fall asleep earlier on school days and wake up later free days in comparison to girls. In conclusion, the experiment developed the hypothesis that sleep is affected by the number of hours spent on social media. It is also encouraged that screen time should be limited to 30 minutes to 2 hours a day for a significant improvement in wellbeing however UK parliament found out that children aged 5-15 are sending an average of 5 hours and 24 minutes (nearly a quarter of their day) engaging in social media activity. Researchers found out that adolescence who spend more than 3 hours on social media has double the risk of developing depression and anxiety. This excessive use of social media is part of the evidence that overuse of social media is detrimental to the wellbeing of young people. The constant checking of social media within the day can consequently lead to disruption in sleeping patterns and sleep deprivation. The main cause of sleep deprivation is due to blue light emitted from the screen, especially during nighttime. Even though blue light is the most beneficial during the daytime, it has proven to be the most disruptive at nighttime. This disruption is due to the suppression of melatonin that blue light causes significantly at nighttime. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that regulates the body’s sleep-wake cycle which plays a crucial role in promoting sleep, regulating the body’s 24-hour clock, treating sleep disorders, protecting against oxidative stress, and modulating the immune system (Harvard Health Publishing, 2024). An experiment was conducted to compare the effects of blue light with green light and it was deemed that blue light suppressed melatonin for twice as long as green light after 6 and a half hours of exposure with green light shifting the circadian rhythm (body’s natural clock) by 1.5 hours whereas green light had twice the effect shifting the circadian system by 3 hours. Ways were shared to protect yourself from blue light including using dim red lights for night light, avoiding looking at bright screens about 2-3 hours before bed, considering using blue-blocking glasses, exposing yourself to bright light during the day to boost your ability to sleep at night.

      <p class="ex1">
        <p>Another issue is the perception of people shown in social media. A survey published by the Mental Health Foundation shares statistics which go on to show that millions of teenagers are now becoming concerned about the way they look. This is due to the concept of ‘the ideal body’ which is shared all over social media. The survey suggested that one-third of teenagers felt ashamed about their body image. 40% of teenagers are worried about body image due to images on social media and more than a third have stopped eating or restricted their diet due to worries about image. In conclusion, the images and ideologies shared on social media have led to many forcing themselves to fit the displayed demographic of the ‘ideal figure.’ Consequently, this leads to rising mental problems, self-harm and suicidal thoughts and feelings.
